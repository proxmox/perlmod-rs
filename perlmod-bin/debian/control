Description: Script to generate perl package files for perlmod libraries.
 This contains the genpackage.pl helper script to produce a set of perl
 packages which load cdylibs made with the perlmod crate. The generated files
 will have a "main" library module which loads the .so file, and a set of
 package files using the main module as a base, sothey all share the same
 library descriptor.
